TITLE="My Wonderful"
LYRICS="''A time when I was down and out
No lovin in my life
this angel came and brought about
a meaning of some right
Took my dark and lonely days
Into the light
With his loving ways

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want
to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
up above
Just for me

Gotta have him close
to me
Each and every night
To give me that security
Of dreaming in delight
Love has got a grip on me
Oh so tight
Hope he never lets go

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want
to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
up above
Just for me

Cause I don't ever want to be free
From this love and care that
most people will never see
And at night I pray
That I'll have my way
And enjoy love for eternity

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want
to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
up above
Just for me

No one can ever do for me
The things he does cause

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want
to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
up above
Just for me''

TITLE="Just Because"
LYRICS="''Ah, remember this?
Why, I must have been thirteen when this came out!
Or was it fourteen?
Or was it twenty-two?
I could have been twelve actually.''

just because you left and said goodbye,
do you think that I will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so,
darling, I would rather let you go.

Just because I want someone who's kind,
with a heart as good and pure as mine.
But maybe I am asking for too much,
darling, please don't ever break my heart.

I know you think you're smart,
just runnin' around breaking lovers hearts.

Just because you left and said goodbye, hey!
Do you think that I will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so,
darling, I would rather let you go.

Uh-uh-uh -

''this is doctor winston o'boggie saying goodnight
from record plant east, new york.
We hope you had a swell time!
Ev'rybody here says ''hi''.
Goodbye.''

just because you left and said goodbye,
do you think that I will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so,
darling, I would rather let you go.

Uh-uh-uh -
goodbye!
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh -
so long!
Been a long year!

TITLE="Ticking"
LYRICS="''An extremely quiet child'' they called you in your school report
''He's always taken interest in the subjects that he's taught''
So what was it that brought the squad car screaming up your drive
To notify your parents of the manner in which you died.

At St. Patrick's every Sunday, Father Fletcher heard your sins
''Oh, he's unconcerned with competition, he never cares to win''
But blood stained a young hand that never held a gun
And his parents never thought of him as their troubled son.

''Now you'll never get to Heaven'' Mama said.
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
''Grow up straight and true blue
Run along to bed''
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking.

They had you holed up in a downtown bar screaming for a priest
Some gook said ''His brains just snapped'' then someone called the police
 You'd knifed a Negro waiter who had tried to calm you down
Oh, you'd pulled a gun and told them all to lay still on the ground.

Promising to hurt no-one, providing they were still
A young man tried to make a break, with tear-filled eyes you killed
That gun butt felt so smooth and warm cradled in your palm
Oh, your childhood cried out in your head, ''They mean to do you harm''.

''Don't ever ride on the devil's knee'' Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
''Pay your penance well, my child
Fear where angels tread''
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking.

Within an hour the news had reached the media machine
A male Caucasian with a gun had gone berserk in Queens'
The area had been sealed off, the kids sent home from school
Fourteen people lying dead in a bar they called the Kicking Mule.

Oh, they pleaded to your sanity for the sake of those inside
''Throw out your gun , walk out slow just keep your hands held high''
But they pumped you full of rifle shells as you stepped out the door
Oh, you danced in death like a marionette on the vengeance of the law.

''You've slept too long in silence'' Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
''Crazy boy, you'll only wind up with strange notions in your head''
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking.

LYRICS="''And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I
don't mind. Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime.''

''If you can hear this whispering you are dying.''

''I never said I was frightened of dying.''

TITLE="Heart-Shaped Box (Demo)"
LYRICS="''Are we rolling?'' 

She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been buried in a heart-shaped box for weeks
You done undid my magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could catch your cancer when I am sick 

(x3)
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice 

Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Your advice (x3) 

I asked me like a Pisces when I've been weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
And in a magnet tar pit film on your trap
I wish I could catch your cancer when I am black 

(x3)
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice 

Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Your advice (x3) 

She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked in heart-shaped coffins for too many weeks
You've drawn me into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could kill your cancer when I am black

(x2)
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice 

Forever in debt to your priceless advice (x2)

Your advice (x3)
